## Requirements

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	&emsp;&emsp;Pyevents <b>only requires Python 3.10+</b> by default, which includes the <code>AsyncIOEventEmitter</code>
	and the <code>ExecutorEventEmitter</code> with no additional dependencies. However, your requirements may expand 
	if you opt to use alternative built-in event emitter implementations.
</p>

## Installation

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	&emsp;&emsp;Pyventus is available as a Python package and can be easily installed using <code>pip</code>. Open your terminal
	and execute the following command to install it:
</p>

```console
pip install pyventus
```

## <code>Hello, World!</code> Example

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;Experience the power of Pyventus through a simple <code>Hello, World!</code> example that illustrates 
	the core concepts and basic usage of the package. This example will walk you through the essential steps of 
	creating an event handler and triggering events within your application.
</p>

```Python title="Hello, World! example with Pyventus" linenums="1"
from pyventus import EventLinker, EventEmitter, AsyncIOEventEmitter


@EventLinker.on("MyEvent")
def event_callback():
    print("Hello, World!")


event_emitter: EventEmitter = AsyncIOEventEmitter()
event_emitter.emit("MyEvent")
```

<details markdown="1" class="info">
<summary>You can also work with <code>async</code> functions and contexts...</summary>

```Python title="Hello, World! example with Pyventus (Async version)" linenums="1" hl_lines="5 14"
from pyventus import EventLinker, EventEmitter, AsyncIOEventEmitter


@EventLinker.on("MyEvent")
async def event_callback():
    print("Hello, World!")


event_emitter: EventEmitter = AsyncIOEventEmitter()
event_emitter.emit("MyEvent")
```

</details>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;As we can see from the <code>Hello, World!</code> example, Pyventus follows a simple and intuitive 
	workflow for event-driven programming. Let's recap the essential steps involved:
</p>

<ol style='text-align: justify;'>

<li>
<b>Defining the event handler callback:</b> We defined the function <code>event_callback()</code> and used the 
<code>@EventLinker.on()</code> decorator to associate it with the string event <code>MyEvent</code>. This decorator
indicates that the function should be triggered when <code>MyEvent</code> occurs.
</li>

<li>
<b>Creating the event emitter instance:</b> We instantiated the <code>AsyncIOEventEmitter</code> class, which acts as 
the event emitter responsible for dispatching events and invoking the associated event handler callbacks.
</li>

<li>
<b>Emitting the event:</b> By utilizing the <code>emit()</code> method of the event emitter, we emitted the string 
event <code>MyEvent</code>. This action subsequently execute the registered event handler callbacks, which in this case
is the <code>event_callback()</code>.
</li>

</ol>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;Having gained a clear understanding of the workflow showcased in the <code>Hello, World!</code> example,
	you are now well-equipped to explore more intricate event-driven scenarios and fully harness the capabilities of 
	Pyventus in your own projects.
</p>

## Support for Synchronous and Asynchronous code

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;Pyventus is designed from the ground up to seamlessly support both synchronous and asynchronous
	programming models. Its unified sync/async API allows you to define event handler callbacks and emit events
	across <code>sync</code> and <code>async</code> contexts. Let's take a look at some use cases that illustrate 
	how the API handles event registration and dispatch transparently.
</p>

### Registering Event Handlers as <code>Sync</code> and <code>Async</code> Callbacks

```Python 
@EventLinker.on("MyEvent")
def sync_event_callback():
    # Synchronous event handling
    print("Event received!")


@EventLinker.on("MyEvent")
async def async_event_callback():
    # Asynchronous event handling
    print("Event received!")  
```

### Emitting Events from <code>Sync</code> and <code>Async</code> Contexts

```Python 
# Emitting an event within a sync function
def sync_function(event_emitter: EventEmitter):
    event_emitter.emit("MyEvent")


# Emitting an event within an async function
async def async_function(event_emitter: EventEmitter):
    event_emitter.emit("MyEvent")
```

<details markdown="1" class="info" open>
<summary>Event Propagation Within Different Contexts</summary>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;While Pyventus provides a base <code>EventEmitter</code> class with a unified sync/async API, the 
	specific propagation behavior when emitting events may vary depending on the concrete <code>EventEmitter</code>
	used. For example, the <code>AsyncIOEventEmitter</code> implementation leverages the <code>AsyncIO</code> event
	loop to schedule callbacks added from asynchronous contexts without blocking. But alternative emitters could 
	structure propagation differently to suit their needs.
</p>

</details>

## Runtime Flexibility and Customization

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;At its core, Pyventus utilizes a modular event emitter design that allows you to switch seamlessly
	between different built-in or custom event emitter implementations on the fly. Whether you opt for official
	emitters or decide to create your custom ones, Pyventus allows you to tailor the behavior and capabilities
	of the event emitters to perfectly align with your unique requirements.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;By leveraging the principles of dependency inversion and open-close, Pyventus decouples the event
	emission process from the underlying implementation that handles the event emission and enables you, in conjunction
	with the <code>EventLinker</code>, to change the event emitter at runtime without the need to reconfigure all 
	connections or employ complex logic.
</p>

### Seeing it in Action

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;Now let's put Pyventus' flexibility to the test with a practical example. First, we'll build a
	custom <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" target="_blank">FastAPI</a> EventEmitter to properly handle
	the event emission using the framework's <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/background/" target="_blank">BackgroundTasks</a>
	workflow. Then, we'll illustrate Pyventus' dynamic capabilities by swapping this custom emitter out for a built-in
	alternative on the fly.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;To follow along, please ensure that you have the FastAPI framework <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/?h=#installation" target="_blank">installed</a>. 
	Once that is complete, let's dive into the step-by-step implementation:
</p>

<ol style='text-align: justify;'>

<li>
Create a <code>main.py</code> file with:

```Python title="main.py" linenums="1"  hl_lines="9 16-17 37 40"
from asyncio import sleep
from random import randint

from fastapi import BackgroundTasks, FastAPI

from pyventus import EventEmitter, EventLinker, AsyncIOEventEmitter


class FastAPIEventEmitter(EventEmitter):
    """Custom event emitter class that leverages the FastAPI's asynchronous workflow."""

    def __init__(self, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
        super().__init__()
        self._background_tasks = background_tasks  # Store the FastAPI background tasks object

    def _process(self, event_emission: EventEmitter.EventEmission) -> None:
        self._background_tasks.add_task(event_emission)  # Execute the event emission as background tasks


@EventLinker.on("console_print")
async def console_print(message: str):
    await sleep(randint(0, 3))  # Simulate a random delay
    print(message)


app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/print")
async def console_print_endpoint(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    """FastAPI endpoint that triggers the console_print event."""

    def console_print_app_service(event_emitter: EventEmitter) -> None:
        event_emitter.emit("console_print", message=f"\nHello, {event_emitter.__class__.__name__}!")

    # Emit the console_print event using FastAPIEventEmitter
    console_print_app_service(event_emitter=FastAPIEventEmitter(background_tasks))

    # Emit the console_print event using AsyncIOEventEmitter
    console_print_app_service(event_emitter=AsyncIOEventEmitter())

    return {"message": "Console print triggered!"}
```

</li> 



<li>
<a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#run-it" target="_blank">Run the server</a> with:

```console
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

</li>

<li>
Open your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/print" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/print</a>. You will 
see the JSON response as:

```JSON
{ "message": "Console print triggered!" }
```

You'll also be able to see the outputs of the event emitters in the console logs as:

```console
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [28720]
INFO:     Started server process [28722]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     127.0.0.1:52391 - "GET /print HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

Hello, FastAPIEventEmitter!

Hello, AsyncIOEventEmitter!
```

</li>

</ol> 

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;As we can see from this practical example, we were able to easily adapt the event emitter to the
	context of the FastAPI framework. We defined and implemented a custom emitter tailored for FastAPI's workflow,
	using background tasks to handle the event emission accordingly.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;We also saw Pyventus' dynamic flexibility firsthand - swapping emitters in real-time required no
	intricate reconfiguration or re-establishing of handlers. Simply changing the concrete emitter allowed for
	a seamless transition between implementations.
</p>

## Defining Event Response Logic

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;As we mentioned earlier, Pyventus allows you to customize how events are processed upon completion in
	success or error scenarios by attaching custom handlers. To utilize this functionality, Pyventus provides a simple
	yet powerful Pythonic syntax through its <code>event linkage context</code>.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;The <code>event linkage context</code> enables defining the event workflow and completion handlers in an
	organized manner. This is done by using the <code>EventLinker.on</code> method within a <code>with</code> statement
	block. Let's examine examples demonstrating how success and failure handlers can be attached using the event linkage
	context:
</p>

### Success and Error Handling Example

```Python linenums="1"  hl_lines="7 10-12"
from pyventus import EventLinker, EventEmitter, AsyncIOEventEmitter


with EventLinker.on("StringEvent") as linker:
	
    @linker.on_event
    def event_callback() -> str:
        print("Event received!")
        return "Event succeeded!"

    @linker.on_success
    def success_callback(msg: str) -> None:
        print(msg)

    @linker.on_failure
    def failure_callback(exc: Exception) -> None:
        print(exc)

	    
event_emitter: EventEmitter = AsyncIOEventEmitter()
event_emitter.emit("StringEvent")
```

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;As we have seen from the examples, Pyventus' event linkage context provides a reliable and Pythonic way
	to manage the event workflow and response to different completion outcomes through the use of custom handlers.
</p>

## Continuous Evolution

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	&emsp;&emsp;Pyventus continuously adapts to support developers across technological and programming domains. Its
	aim is to remain at the forefront of event-driven design. Future development may introduce new official event 
	emitters, expanding compatibility with different technologies through seamless integration.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	&emsp;&emsp;Current default emitters provide reliable out-of-the-box capabilities for common use cases. They
	efficiently handle core event operations and lay the foundation for building event-driven applications.
