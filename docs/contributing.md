## Project Structure and Conventions

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	&emsp;&emsp;This project follows the <a href="https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/" target="_blank">src-layout</a> convention for Python packages. This convention improves code organization, facilitates easy testing and usage, and allows developers to install the package in <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#working-in-development-mode" target="_blank">editable mode</a>. By adhering to this convention, we can validate the package thoroughly in a realistic environment, leading to a higher quality and user-friendly product.
</p>

### Code Standards

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	&emsp;&emsp;At Pyventus, ensuring a high-quality and maintainable codebase is essential. Therefore, the following code standards have been established to guide the development process as well as promote consistency:
</p>

-   <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>PEP-8 Compliance</b> ─ 
    	Follow the guidelines outlined in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" target="_blank">PEP-8</a> to ensure clean and readable Python code. Adhering to these standards promotes consistency, enhances code comprehension, and facilitates collaboration among contributors.
    </p>

-   <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Meaningful Naming</b> ─ 
    	Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Clear and intuitive naming enhances code comprehension, making it easier for everyone to understand and work with the code.
    </p>

-   <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Modularity and Reusability</b> ─ 
    	Encourage the development of modular and reusable code. Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, self-contained components promotes maintainability, reduces complexity, and allows for scalability and extensibility.
    </p>

-   <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Optimization and Efficiency</b> ─ 
    	Strive for efficient code by considering algorithmic complexity and optimizing where necessary. Writing code that is both correct and performant ensures responsive and scalable applications.
    </p>

-   <p style="text-align: justify;" class="annotate" markdown><b>Class Structure</b> ─ 
    	While there are no strict rules for structuring classes in Python beyond common sense and readability, Pyventus has established a recommended class structure that provides a foundation for a consistent codebase.(1)
    </p>

    1.  <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Recommended Class Structure</h2>

        ```sh
        Class Name

        1. Inner Classes and Class Attributes

</p>

### Pre-Submission Testing and Validation

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	&emsp;&emsp;Before submitting your pull request, it is crucial to ensure that your changes pass all necessary checks. To do so, simply run the following command:
</p>

<div class="terminal-command">
```console
hatch run tests:all
```
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	&emsp;&emsp;This command will trigger the Hatch project manager to initiate a comprehensive testing process across all supported Python versions. It will run tests, perform type checks, ensure code linting and formatting, and measure code coverage. This ensures that your changes meet the required quality standards.

!!! warning "Troubleshooting Hatch Environment Errors"

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    	&emsp;&emsp;If commands run successfully when executed manually but produce unexpected errors or misbehavior when run within a Hatch environment, even though the dependencies are declared correctly, this could indicate an issue with the Hatch environment cache. To resolve potential cache-related issues, you can remove the environment and clear its cache by running:
    </p>

    <div class="terminal-command">
    ```console
    hatch env remove [ENV_NAME]
    ```
    </div>

    <p style='text-align: justify;'>
    	&emsp;&emsp;Alternatively, if you prefer to take a more comprehensive approach by removing all environments and clearing their caches, you can do so by running the following command:
    </p>

    <div class="terminal-command">
    ```console
    hatch env prune
    ```
    </div>
