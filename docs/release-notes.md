## v0.3.0

### What's Changed

##### Breaking Changes

- Introduced `EventEmission` object to encapsulate the processing of event emissions. This changes the `_execute()`
  method of EventEmitter but provides a cleaner, more scalable, and efficient approach.
- Renamed EventEmitter's `_execute()` method to `_process()` to better reflect its purpose of processing event
  emissions.
- Renamed all debug flags from `debug_mode` to `debug` for enhanced clarity and consistency.

##### New Features

- Added `CeleryEventEmitter` implementation to leverage the Celery distributed task queue for event handling.
- Included documentation for `CeleryEventEmitter` including tutorials and API references.

##### Refactors

- Restructured documentation for event emitters tutorials and API references.
- Restructured tests for event emitters tutorials and API references.

## v0.2.1

### What's Changed

##### Fixes

- Fixed issues with invalid links in the documentation.
- Updated docstring links to the official Pyventus documentation.
- Resolved the issue where the `RQEventEmitter` optional dependency had to be installed by default to use the package.
  It is now fully optional.

## v0.1.0

### Initial Implementation

&emsp;&emsp;This release introduces Pyventus 0.1.0, a modern and robust Python package for event-driven programming.
Pyventus provides developers with a comprehensive suite of tools and utilities to define, emit, and orchestrate events.
It empowers developers to build scalable, extensible, and loosely-coupled event-driven applications.

- **Implementation Details:** The first implementation includes all the core functionalities of the package,
  encompassing events, event linkers, event emitters, event handlers, and more.
- **Testing and Coverage:** This release includes a test suite that verifies the correctness of the package
  implementation. It also integrates code coverage, achieving 100% test coverage. The tests are configured to run
  automatically via GitHub Actions on both push and pull requests to the master branch.
- **Formatter and Lint Configuration:** A formatter and lint configuration have been added to the project. This ensures
  consistent code style, maintainability, and adherence to the established coding standards defined in the project
  documentation.
- **Documentation:** Additionally, this release includes comprehensive documentation for the package. The documentation
  covers the main page, a detailed getting started guide, tutorials, API reference, and release notes.
