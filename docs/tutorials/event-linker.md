# The EventLinker Registry

!!! warning "üèóÔ∏è Work in Progress"
    This page is a work in progress.

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;Events are essential for building reactive applications with Pyventus. However, we need a way to connect
	events to the code that should run in response. This is where the `EventLinker` comes in.
</p>

## What is the EventLinker?

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;The `EventLinker` is a central class that acts as a registry for linking events to their associated 
	event handlers. It keeps track of which events have event handlers assigned to them, so when an event occurs it knows
	which code needs to run.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;The `EventLinker` can also be subclassed to create separate linking registries, allowing you to define
	different namespaces or contexts for events and event handlers. 
</p>

## Benefits of Using The EventLinker

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	Using the `EventLinker` class offers several advantages:
</p>

<ul style='text-align: justify;' markdown>

<li markdown>**Clear separation of concerns** - 
The emitter class focuses only on emitting events, while the linker handles all the subscription logic. This makes
both classes cleaner and easier to understand, as well as allowing them to be modified independently as needed.
</li>

<li markdown>**Centralized logic** - 
Having global registries means there is only one place to go to see which events have event handlers. This simplifies
management of the overall event system.
</li>

<li markdown>**Flexibility** - 
You can change the event emitter instance at runtime without the need to reconfigure all connections.
</li>

</ul>

## Event Handlers

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;Before proceeding, we should first understand the concept behind event handlers and what they do. An 
	event handler is a callable object designed to respond to a specific event. When an event occurs, such as a button
	click, mouse movement, or a timer expiration, these objects are executed concurrently in response.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;The `EventHandler` class encapsulates the event callbacks and provides a standardized mechanism for 
	executing them when the event occurs. It handles the asynchronous and synchronous execution of event callbacks, 
	as well as the completion workflow for success and error handling.
</p>

## Subscribing Event Handlers

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;The `EventLinker` makes it easy to subscribe event handlers to respond to events. Let's explore the
	different approaches to subscribing event handlers.
</p>

### Subscription Basics

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;Pyventus supports two types of subscriptions to handle callback registration: regular subscriptions and
	one-time subscriptions. Each subscription, regardless of type, will create a separate `EventHandler` instance
	independently. So subscribing the same callback multiple times to an event will cause it to be invoked
	multiple times. 
</p>

### Regular Subscriptions

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	&emsp;&emsp;Regular subscriptions trigger the event handler each time the subscribed event(s) occur, and the
	handler remains subscribed until explicitly unsubscribed. Below we will explore how to subscribe regular
	event handlers.
</p>

#### Using decorators

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    Decorators provide a clean Python syntax for subscribing handlers.
</p>

=== "`Sync` context"

	```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="2 8"
	# Subscribe to one event
	@EventLinker.on("StringEvent")
	def event_callback1():
	    print("Event received!")
	
	
	# Subscribe to multiple events at once
	@EventLinker.on("StringEvent", "AnotherEvent", "ThirdEvent")
	def event_callback2():
	    print("Event received!")
	```

=== "`Async` context"

	```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="2-3 8-9"
	# Subscribe to one event
	@EventLinker.on("StringEvent")
	async def event_callback1():
	    print("Event received!")
	
	
	# Subscribe to multiple events at once
	@EventLinker.on("StringEvent", "AnotherEvent", "ThirdEvent")
	async def event_callback2():
	    print("Event received!")
	```

#### Using the subscribe() method

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    You can also subscribe event handlers by calling the `subscribe()` method.
</p>

=== "`Sync` context"

	```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="6 9"
	def event_callback():
	    print("Event received!")
	
	
	# Subscribe to one event
	EventLinker.subscribe("StringEvent", event_callback=event_callback)
	
	# Subscribe to multiple events at once
	EventLinker.subscribe("StringEvent", "AnotherEvent", "ThirdEvent", event_callback=event_callback)
	```

=== "`Async` context"

	```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="1 6 9"
	async def event_callback():
	    print("Event received!")
	
	
	# Subscribe to one event
	EventLinker.subscribe("StringEvent", event_callback=event_callback)
	
	# Subscribe to multiple events at once
	EventLinker.subscribe("StringEvent", "AnotherEvent", "ThirdEvent", event_callback=event_callback)
	```

### One-time Subscriptions

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	&emsp;&emsp;One-time subscriptions trigger the event handler only once, then automatically unsubscribe it.
	One-time handlers are useful for tasks that should only run once.
</p>

!!! info "Behavior with Multiple Events"

	<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	    When subscribing a one-time handler to multiple events, if one event fires it will automatically unsubscribe
		the event handler from all other events.
	</p>

#### Using decorators

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    In order to perform a one-time subscription using decorators we use the `once()` method:
</p>

=== "`Sync` context"

	```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="2 8"
	# Subscribe to one event
	@EventLinker.once("StringEvent")
	def event_callback1():
	    print("Event received!")
	
	
	# Subscribe to multiple events at once
	@EventLinker.once("StringEvent", "AnotherEvent", "ThirdEvent")
	def event_callback2():
	    print("Event received!")
	```

=== "`Async` context"

	```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="2-3 8-9"
	# Subscribe to one event
	@EventLinker.once("StringEvent")
	async def event_callback1():
	    print("Event received!")
	
	
	# Subscribe to multiple events at once
	@EventLinker.once("StringEvent", "AnotherEvent", "ThirdEvent")
	async def event_callback2():
	    print("Event received!")
	```

#### Using the subscribe() method

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    Alternatively, you can also use the `subscribe()` method to do a one-time subscription too:
</p>

=== "`Sync` context"

	```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="6 9 12 16 18"
	def event_callback():
	    print("Event received!")
	
	
	# Subscribe to one event
	EventLinker.subscribe(
		"StringEvent", 
		event_callback=event_callback, 
		once=True,
	)
	
	# Subscribe to multiple events at once
	EventLinker.subscribe(
		"StringEvent", "AnotherEvent", "ThirdEvent", 
		event_callback=event_callback, 
		once=True,
	)
	```

=== "`Async` context"

	```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="1 6 9 13 16 18"
	async def event_callback():
	    print("Event received!")
	
	
	# Subscribe to one event
	EventLinker.subscribe(
		"StringEvent", 
		event_callback=event_callback, 
		once=True,
	)
	
	# Subscribe to multiple events at once
	EventLinker.subscribe(
		"StringEvent", "AnotherEvent", "ThirdEvent", 
		event_callback=event_callback, 
		once=True,
	)
	```

### Success and Error Handling

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;In the previous sections, we discussed the process of subscribing callback functions to handle events 
	using Pyventus' event linker. However, there may be times when we need more control over the exact workflow.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;In this section, we'll show you how to define custom logic to process events upon completion using
	success and failure handlers. It's important to have reliable control over the asynchronous flow to build robust
	apps.
</p>

#### Response Logic For Regular Subscriptions

=== "Using Decorators"

	```Python linenums="1"  hl_lines="1 3-4 7-8 11-12"
	with EventLinker.on("DivisionEvent") as linker:  # (1)!

	    @linker.on_event
	    def handle_division(a: float, b: float) -> float:
	        return a / b
	
	    @linker.on_success
	    def handle_success(result: float) -> None:
	        print(f"Division result: {result:.3g}")
	
	    @linker.on_failure
	    def handle_failure(e: Exception) -> None:
	        print(f"Oops, something went wrong: {e}")
	```
	
	1. When the `EventLinker.on` method is used as a context manager via the `with` statement, it allows multiple
	   callbacks to be associated with events within the `linkage context block`, defining the event workflow.

=== "Using the `subscribe()` method"

	```Python linenums="1"  hl_lines="1 4 7 13-15"
	def handle_division(a: float, b: float) -> float:
		return a / b
	
	def handle_success(result: float) -> None:
		print(f"Division result: {result:.3g}")
	
	def handle_failure(e: Exception) -> None:
		print(f"Oops, something went wrong: {e}")
	

	EventLinker.subscribe(
	    "DivisionEvent", 
		event_callback=handle_division, 
		success_callback=handle_success, 
		failure_callback=handle_failure,
	)
	```

#### Response Logic For One-time Subscriptions

=== "Using Decorators"

	```Python linenums="1"  hl_lines="1 3-4 7-8 11-12"
	with EventLinker.once("DivisionEvent") as linker:  # (1)!

	    @linker.on_event
	    def handle_division(a: float, b: float) -> float:
	        return a / b
	
	    @linker.on_success
	    def handle_success(result: float) -> None:
	        print(f"Division result: {result:.3g}")
	
	    @linker.on_failure
	    def handle_failure(e: Exception) -> None:
	        print(f"Oops, something went wrong: {e}")
	```
	
	1. When the `EventLinker.once` method is used as a context manager via the `with` statement, it allows multiple
	   callbacks to be associated with events within the `linkage context block`, defining the event workflow.

=== "Using the `subscribe()` method"

	```Python linenums="1"  hl_lines="1 4 7 13-16"
	def handle_division(a: float, b: float) -> float:
		return a / b
	
	def handle_success(result: float) -> None:
		print(f"Division result: {result:.3g}")
	
	def handle_failure(e: Exception) -> None:
		print(f"Oops, something went wrong: {e}")
	

	EventLinker.subscribe(
	    "DivisionEvent", 
		event_callback=handle_division, 
		success_callback=handle_success, 
		failure_callback=handle_failure,
		once=True,
	)
	```

## Optimizing Callbacks Execution

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
    &emsp;&emsp;By default, event handlers in Pyventus are executed concurrently during an event emission, running their
	<code>sync</code> and <code>async</code> callbacks as defined. However, if you have a <code>sync</code> callback
	that involves I/O or non-CPU bound operations, you can enable the <code>force_async</code> parameter to offload it
	to a thread pool, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness. The <code>force_async</code> parameter utilizes 
	the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#running-in-threads" target="_blank"><code>asyncio.to_thread()</code></a>
	function to execute <code>sync</code> callbacks asynchronously.
</p>

=== "Using Decorators"

	```Python linenums="1"  hl_lines="3"
	# You can also set this when using the `with` 
	# statement and the `once()` decorator
	@EventLinker.on("BlockingIO", force_async=True)
	def blocking_io():
	    print(f"start blocking_io at {time.strftime('%X')}")
	    # Note that time.sleep() can be replaced with any blocking
	    # IO-bound operation, such as file operations.
	    time.sleep(1)
	    print(f"blocking_io complete at {time.strftime('%X')}")
	```

=== "Using the `subscribe()` method"

	```Python linenums="1"  hl_lines="1 8 10-11"
	def blocking_io():
	    print(f"start blocking_io at {time.strftime('%X')}")
	    # Note that time.sleep() can be replaced with any blocking
	    # IO-bound operation, such as file operations.
	    time.sleep(1)
	    print(f"blocking_io complete at {time.strftime('%X')}")
	
	EventLinker.subscribe(
	    "BlockingIO",
	    event_callback=blocking_io,
	    force_async=True,
	)
	```

## Unsubscribing Event Handlers

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;Removing event handlers is an important part of working with events. Let's look at different approaches
	to properly teardown event subscriptions:
</p>

### Removing an Event Handler from an Event

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	To remove a single event handler from a specific event:
</p>

```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="5 7"
def event_callback():
    print("Event received!")


event_handler = EventLinker.subscribe("StringEvent", "AnotherEvent", event_callback=event_callback)

EventLinker.unsubscribe("StringEvent", event_handler=event_handler)  # (1)!
```

1. Removes the `event_handler` from just the `StringEvent`

### Removing Event Handlers from All Events

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	To remove an event handler from all subscribed events:
</p>

```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="5 7"
def event_callback():
    print("Event received!")


event_handler = EventLinker.subscribe("StringEvent", "AnotherEvent", event_callback=event_callback)

EventLinker.remove_event_handler(event_handler=event_handler)  # (1)!
```

1. Removes the `event_handler` from the `StringEvent` and `AnotherEvent`

### Removing an Event and its Event Handlers

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	To delete an event and all associated handlers:
</p>

```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="1 6 11"
@EventLinker.on("StringEvent")
def event_callback1():
    print("Event received!")


@EventLinker.on("StringEvent", "AnotherEvent")
def event_callback2():
    print("Event received!")


EventLinker.remove_event(event="StringEvent")  # (1)!
```

1. Removes all event handlers associated with the `StringEvent`

### Clearing All Events

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	To remove all events and their handlers:
</p>

```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="1 6 11"
@EventLinker.on("StringEvent", ...)
def event_callback1():
    pass


@EventLinker.on(...)
def event_callback2():
    pass


EventLinker.remove_all() 
```

## Custom Event Linkers

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	&emsp;&emsp;The `EventLinker` class in Pyventus was designed to support subclassing to allow you to define separate
	*linking registries* or *namespaces* for your events and handlers, as well as configure the `EventLinker` behavior.
	This approach provides a powerful way to customize how events are linked within your applications. Some key reasons
	for using custom linkers include:
</p>

<ul style='text-align: justify;' markdown>

<li markdown>
Organizing events into logical domains/contexts.
</li>

<li markdown>
Isolating events to only be accessible within certain scopes.
</li>

<li markdown>
Configuring linker-specific options like max handlers per event.
</li>

</ul>

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	To define a custom linker, subclass the `EventLinker`, as shown below:
</p>

```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="1 6 11"
class UserEventLinker(EventLinker, max_event_handlers=10):
    """ EventLinker for User's events only """
    pass  # Additional logic can be added here if needed...


@UserEventLinker.on("PasswordResetEvent")
async def handle_password_reset_event(email: str):
    print("PasswordResetEvent received!")


@UserEventLinker.on("EmailVerifiedEvent")
async def handle_email_verified_event(email: str):
    print("EmailVerifiedEvent received!")
```

## Debug Mode

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	&emsp;&emsp;The `EventLinker` also offers a debug mode feature which helps you understand how event subscriptions
	and unsubscriptions are happening during runtime.
</p>

### Global Debug Mode

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
	&emsp;&emsp;By default, Pyventus leverages the Python's global debug tracing feature. Simply run your code in an
	IDE's debugger mode to activate the global debug mode tracing.
</p>

<p align="center">
   <img src="../../images/examples/debug-mode-example.png" alt="EventLinker Global Debug Mode" width="900px">
</p>

### Namespace Debug Flag

<p style='text-align: justify;' markdown>
    &emsp;&emsp;Alternatively, if you want to enable or disable the debug mode specifically for a certain `EventLinker` 
	namespace, you can use the `debug` flag that is available in the subclass configurations. Setting the
	`debug` flag to `True` enables debug mode for that namespace, while setting it to `False` disables
	debug mode. Here's an example:
</p>

=== "Debug Flag `On`"

	```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
	class CustomEventLinker(EventLinker, debug=True):
	    pass  # Additional logic can be added here if needed...
	```

=== "Debug Flag `Off`"

	```Python linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
	class CustomEventLinker(EventLinker, debug=False):
	    pass  # Additional logic can be added here if needed...
	```
