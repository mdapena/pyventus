class AsyncIOEventEmitter(EventEmitter):
    """
    A class that inherits from `EventEmitter` and uses the `AsyncIO` framework to handle
    the execution of the event handlers.

    **Asynchronous Execution**: In an asynchronous context where an event loop is already
    running, the event emission is scheduled and processed on that existing loop. If the
    event loop is closed before all callbacks complete, any remaining scheduled callback
    will be canceled.

    **Synchronous Execution**: In a synchronous context where no event loop is active, a new event
    loop is started and subsequently closed by the `asyncio.run()` method. Within this loop, it
    executes the event emission. The loop then waits for all scheduled tasks to finish before
    closing. This preserves synchronous execution while still gaining the benefits of the
    concurrent execution.

    For more information and code examples, please refer to the `AsyncIOEventEmitter`
    tutorials at: [https://mdapena.github.io/pyventus/tutorials/emitters/asyncio/](https://mdapena.github.io/pyventus/tutorials/emitters/asyncio/).
