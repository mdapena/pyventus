    An abstract base class for event emitters.

    This abstract base class defines a common interface for emitting events. It serves as
    a foundation for  implementing custom event emitters with specific dispatch strategies.
    It is designed to handle `string-named` events with variable-length argument list and
    arbitrary keyword arguments, as well as instances of `Event` objects and `Exceptions`.

    The main goal of this class is to decouple the dispatching of event handler callbacks
    from the underlying implementation. This loose coupling promotes flexibility and
    adaptability through separation of concerns, allowing custom event emitters to
    be implemented without affecting existing consumers.

    For more information and code examples, please refer to the `EventEmitter` tutorials
    at: [https://mdapena.github.io/pyventus/tutorials/emitters/](https://mdapena.github.io/pyventus/tutorials/emitters/).

        Represents an event emission that has been triggered but whose propagation is not
        yet complete. It provides a self-contained context for executing the event emission,
        encapsulating both the event data and the associated event handlers.

        This class acts as an immutable and isolated unit of work to asynchronously propagate
        the emission of an event.

        This class is managed by the `EventEmitter` class, which creates an instance when an
        event is emitted. This instance is then processed by the EventEmitter's `_process()`
        method.
