class ExecutorEventEmitter(EventEmitter):
    """
    An event emitter that executes event handlers using an `Executor`.

    This class utilizes the `concurrent.futures` Executor base class to handle asynchronous
    execution of event emissions. It can work with either `ThreadPoolExecutor` for thread-based
    execution or `ProcessPoolExecutor` for process-based execution.

    By inheriting from `EventEmitter` and utilizing the `Executor` interface, this class
    provides a consistent way to emit events and execute handlers asynchronously in either
    threads or processes. This allows choosing the optimal execution approach based on
    application needs.

    **Note:** It is important to properly manage the underlying `Executor` when using
    this event emitter. Once finished emitting events, call the `shutdown()` method to
    signal the executor to free any resources for pending futures.

    - You can avoid having to call this method explicitly if you use the `with` statement,
      which will shut down the `Executor` (waiting as if `Executor.shutdown()` were called
      with `wait` set to `True`).

    For more information and code examples, please refer to the `ExecutorEventEmitter`
    tutorials at: [https://mdapena.github.io/pyventus/tutorials/emitters/executor/](https://mdapena.github.io/pyventus/tutorials/emitters/executor/).
